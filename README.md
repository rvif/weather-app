# weather_app

 My project for the IP-I evaluation.


 â€¢ A simple Weather App, that uses two different API's to search and display different info regarding the current weather of a city.

1. `Unsplash API` : To update the backdrop images dynamically based on what the weather description of the city is.
2. `OpenWeather API` : To fetch all the details regarding weather and other meteorological phenomenon.


### Preview of the website

It shows the weather of `Mumbai` by default.

### After searching

After every search the backdrop image is changed to suit the `weather description`.

### Search-Bar

If the spelling of the searched city is incorrect, an `alert` is thrown.
